# Breezest

## About:
A comprehensive weather application that allows user to search for a city and diplay the current weather conditions and a 5-day forecast.
The data is fetched using the `OpenWeatherMap API`. The application has a dynamic background which changes from `Cool -> Warm` based on temperature of that place alongwith visibility depictions which change dynamically with the weather conditions.\
The application also has a beautiful dynamic toast message which notifies the user that an action is taking place in background upon their clicks.\
The user can also view wind speed, humidity, real feel, sunrise and sunset time of the place and can also switch between temperature units - `°C` or `°F`.\
The user is also provided with the ability to view weather of their current location alongwith a `quick access` of cities at the top.
